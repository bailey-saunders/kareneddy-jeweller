            <br>
            <p>Karen Eddy Jewellery is committed to providing quality services to you and this
                policy outlines our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage your
                Personal Information.
                <br><br>
                We have adopted the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy
                Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act). The NPPs govern the way in which we collect,
                use, disclose, store, secure and dispose of your Personal Information.
                <br><br>
                A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of

            <br><br>
            <b>What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?</b>

            <p>Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of Personal
                Information we collect include names, addresses, email addresses, phone and facsimile numbers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This Personal Information is obtained in many ways including correspondence, by telephone and facsimile,
                by email, via our website <a href="index.html" class="privacy-policy-link">www.kareneddy.com.au</a> and
                from third parties. We don't guarantee website links
                or policy of authorised third parties.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you, providing
                information to our clients and marketing. We may also use your Personal Information for secondary
                purposes closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances where you would reasonably expect such
                use or disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our mailing/marketing lists at any time by contacting us in
                writing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When we collect Personal Information we will, where appropriate and where possible, explain to you why we
                are collecting the information and how we plan to use it.</p>
            <br>
            <b>Sensitive Information</b>
            <p>Sensitive information is defined in the Privacy Act to include information or opinion about such things
                as an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association,
                religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal
                record or health information.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sensitive information will be used by us only:</p>
            <br>
            <ol id="sensitive-information">
                <li>
                    For the primary purpose for which it was obtained
                </li>
                <li>
                    For a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose
                </li>
                <li>
                    With your consent; or where required or authorised by law.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <b>Third Parties</b>
            <p>Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from you.
                However, in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third parties. In such a case we
                will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the information provided to us by the
                third party.</p>
            <br>
            <b>Disclosure of Personal Information</b>
            <p>Your Personal Information may be disclosed in a number of circumstances including
                the following: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Third parties where you consent to the use or disclosure; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where required or authorised by law.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <b>Security of Personal Information</b>
            <p>Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse and loss and from
                unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When your Personal Information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was obtained, we will
                take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal Information. However, most of
                the Personal Information is or will be stored in client files which will be kept by us for a minimum of
                7 years.</p>
            <br>
            <b>Access to your Personal Information</b>
            <p>You may access the Personal Information we hold about you and to update and/or correct it, subject to
                certain exceptions. If you wish to access your Personal Information, please contact us in writing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Karen Eddy Jewellery will not charge any fee for your access request but may charge an administrative
                fee for providing a copy of your Personal Information.
                In order to protect your Personal Information, we may require identification from you before releasing
                the requested information.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Maintaining the Quality of your Personal Information</b>
            <p>It is important to us that your Personal Information is up to date. We will take reasonable steps to make
                sure that your Personal Information is accurate, complete, and up to date. If you find that the
                information we have is not up to date or is inaccurate, please advise us as soon as practicable so we
